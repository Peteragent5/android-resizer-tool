# Introduction
Android Resizer Tool is written in C and C++. It helps to convert/resize images into other Android densities such as ldpi, mdpi, hdpi, and xhdpi, automatically. This can be used as a command line tool, as well as a CLI tool.

Make sure you have Java installed, as this tool requires it.

Using a ratio and baseline for each density, you're able to convert images to another density.

- XXHDPI (3.0x)
- XHDPI (2.0x)
- HDPI (1.5x)
- MDPI (1x) - Baseline
- LDPI  (0.75x)

### Usage
- \*no argument\* (load console menu)
- -c (convert)
- -h (display help)
- -v (display tool version)
- setup (to modify settings)
